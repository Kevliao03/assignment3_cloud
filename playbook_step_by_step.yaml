# Purpose:
#   This playbook can be used if you would like to try doing
#   the actions from the master playbook step by step. Simply
#   copy the next play from the master to here and execute
#   just this play and make sure it is working. If everything
#   works correctly, you may then terminate your VMs once again
#   and just run the master playbook end to end
